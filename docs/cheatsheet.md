# Cheat Sheet
In this file we list facts, commands, and other information that could be of use while working with the Continuum benchmark. The commands are related to infrastructure (e.g. QEMU VMs) and benchmarking (e.g. Kubernetes). Experts on this topic can most likely ignore this file. We also list some miscelanious information, such as how we store the data generated by the Continuum framework.

## Files
We generate different files during execution, and store them in various places on the host machine(s).

| **What**            | **Location**             | **Description**                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| VM images           | /var/lib/libvirt/images/ | Virtual machine images and configuration files |
| Configuration files | ~/.continuum/            | All configuration files used for the framework |
| Logs                | continuum/logs/          | Saves a log file for each time you use the framework |
| SSH key             | ~/.ssh/id_rsa_continuum  | SSH key used to access the VMs

## Containers
A Docker registry is created, listening at ip ${host_ip} and port 5000. All required application docker images are pulled to this Docker registry once, and can be updated using the "docker_pull" option in the configuration file. All VMs get the application's images from this registry. This is done because pulling images across possible 100s of VMs is expensive, and will most likely result in a block from the docker registry such as DockerHub (they have a pull limited per X hours).

## Commands
A list of commands that can help you navigate the different parts of the framework when developing or debugging features.


### VM
Commands for accessing and creating VMs
The SSH commands needed to access the VMs will be printed at the end of each Continuum run, unless the "delete" option from the configuration file is used as deleted VMs can no longer be accessed anymore.

| **Command**              | **Description**                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ssh user@ip -i key       | SSH into a VM                                           |
| virsh list               | List all active VMs (possible with the --all flag)      |
| virsh destroy vm_name    | Kill a VM                                               |
| virsh list --all \| \ <br> grep -o -E "(cloud\w*\|edge\w*\|endpoint\w*\|base\w*)" \| \ <br> xargs -I % sh -c 'virsh destroy %' | Kill all VMs created by the Continuum framework       |

### Docker
Commands for the Docker container service

| **Command**              | **Description**                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| docker images            | Show available Docker images                            |
| docker container ls -a   | Show running and exited Docker containers with their ID |
| docker container logs ID | Get the output of a Docker container                    |

### Kubernetes / KubeEdge
Commands for using Kubernetes and derivates.

| **Command**              | **Description**                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| kubectl get nodes        | List all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster                |
| kubectl get pods         | List all pods running or stopped in the cluster         |
| kubectl logs podname     | Get the output of a pod                                 |
